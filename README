How does this work?
-------------------

Your video material is divided into several partitions (depends on how many 
threads are used). Each *skipframes* frame is analyzed by OpenCVs uniconrtastic
algorithm. Then motion vectors are calculated for every point in the comparsion 
grid. If vector is long enough, the fireball was detected. So the clip is cut.
Clip begins 1 second before firaball detection and ends *clip-len* later.
At the end clips are merged into output video.

How to install?
---------------

If you are using Windows, you can download binaries, extract them and use.
Also you can add FFB direcotry to your PATH or something.

If you are brave enough to compile it (or if you are using Linux or other OS).
You will need:
    - Boost 1.47.0 (thread, program_options, system, filesystem libs)
    - OpenCV 2.3.1
    - A lot of luck
    - GCC with C++0x support (or MinGW if you are brave Windows user)
    - CMake >= 2.6

1. Generate Makefile:
(in main ffb dir)

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. 

Feel free to discover cmake options ;)

2. Compile ffb

    make

3. Copy binaries whereever you wnat. Remember to provide OpenCV DLLs if you
choose to use dynamic libs.
